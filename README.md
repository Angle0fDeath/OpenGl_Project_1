Tic Tac Toe with animations

This is a plain opengl practice project. It suffices the requirements for the first project during the semester. It was fun to create and a good learning opportunity. The project consists of a tic tac toe with animations on marker placement and loading bar. Also it contains an AI and changeable themes. Keeping you here more than this would be wasteful for an introduction on a tic tac toe project, so head on and dive into the project description itself. I hope you enjoy it and find it helpful or pleasant.
